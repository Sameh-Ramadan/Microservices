•	Containers allow us to execute the software we are developing in
any environment—the developer’s machine to a physical or virtual enterprise
server.

•	A virtual machine (VM) allows us to emulate the operation of a computer
within another computer. This is based on a hypervisor that mimics the complete
physical machine, allocating the desired amount of system memory, processor
cores, disk storage, and other resources such as networks, PCI add-ons, and so forth.

•	Containers are another operating system (OS) virtualization method that allows
you to run an application with its dependent elements in an isolated and independent
environment.

•	The use of containers reduces general costs by creating lightweight VMs that
speed up the run/execution process, therefore reducing the costs of each
project.

•	Docker is a popular open source container engine based on Linux containers.

•	Docker is composed of the following components: Docker Engines, clients,
Registries, images, containers, volumes, and networks.

•	A Dockerfile is a simple text file that contains a list of instructions and commands
that the Docker client calls to create and prepare an image. This file
automates the image creation process. The commands used in the Dockerfile
are similar to Linux commands, which makes the Dockerfile commands easier
to understand.

•	Docker Compose is a service orchestration tool that allows you to define services
as a group and then launch them together as a single unit.

•	Docker Compose is installed as part of the Docker installation process.

•	The Dockerfile Maven plugin integrates Maven with Docker.
